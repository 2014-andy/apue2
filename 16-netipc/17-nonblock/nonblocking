Normally, the recv() functions will block when no data is immediately
available. Similarly, the send() functions will block when there is not
enough room in the socket's output queue to send the message. This behavior
changes when the socket is in nonblocking mode. In this case, these
functions will fail instead of blocking, setting errno to either
EWOULDBLOCK or EAGAIN. When this happens, we can use either poll() or
select() to determine when we can receive or transmit data.

书中另外还提到了 Asynchronouts I/o 的概念.
