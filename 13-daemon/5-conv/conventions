Several common conventions are followed by daemons in the UNIX System.
1. If the daemon uses a lock file, the file is usually stored in /var/run.
Note, however, that the daemon might need superuser permissions to create
a file here. The name of the file is usually name.pid, where name is the
name of the daemon or the service.
2. If the daemon supports configuration options, they are usually stored in
/etc/. The configuration file is named name.conf, where name is the name of
the daemon or the name of the service.
3. Daemons can be started from the command line, but they are usually
started from one of the system initialization scripts (/etc/rc* or
/etc/init.d/*). If the daemon should be restarted automatically when it
exits, we can arrange for init to restart it if we include a respawn entry
for it in /etc/inittab.
4. If a daemon has a configuration file, the daemon reads it when it starts,
but usually won't look at it again. If an administrator changes the
configuration, the daemon would need to be stopped and restarted to account
for the configuration changes.
