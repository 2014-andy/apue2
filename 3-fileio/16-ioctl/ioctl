The ioctl function has always been the catchall for I/O operations.
Anything that couldn't be expressed using one of the other functions in
this chapter (Chapter 3) usually ended up being specified with an ioctl().

#include <sys/ioctl.h>		/* Linux */
int ioctl(int filedes, int request, ...);
	Returns: -1 on error, something else if OK.
