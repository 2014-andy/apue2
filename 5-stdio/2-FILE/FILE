When we open or create a file with the standard I/O library, we say that
we have associated a stream with the file.

When we open a stream, the standard I/O function fopen() returns a pointer
to a FILE object. This object is normally a structure that contains all the
information required by the standard I/O library to manage the stream: the
file descriptor used for actual I/O, a pointer to a buffer for the stream,
the size of the buffer, a count of the number of characters currently in
the buffer, an error flag, and the like.

Application software should never need to examine a FILE object. To
reference the stream, we pass its FILE pointer as an argument to each
standard I/O function.

Standard Input, Standard Output, and Standard Error
Three streams are predefined and automatically available to a process:
standard input, standard output, and standard error. These streams refer to
the same file descriptors STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, and STDERR_FILENO.

These three standard I/O streams are referenced through the predefined file
pointers stdin, stdout, and stderr. The file pointers are defined in the
file <stdio.h> header.
