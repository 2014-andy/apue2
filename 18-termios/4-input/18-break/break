Another "character" that we need to define for terminal devices is the
BREAK character. BREAK is not really a character, but rather a condition
that occurs during asynchronous serial data transmission. A BREAK condition
is signaled to the device driver in various ways, depending on the serial
interface.

Most old serial terminals have a key labeled BREAK that generates the
BREAK condition, which is why most people think of BREAK as a character.
Some newer terminal keyboards don't have a BREAK key. On PCs, the break
key might be mapped for other purpose. For example, the Windows command
interpreter can be interrupted by typing Control-BREAK.

For asynchronous serial data transmisstion, a BREAK is a sequence of
zero-valued bits that continues for longer than the time requested to send
one byte. The entire sequence of zero-valued bits is considered a single
BREAK. In Section 18.8, we'll see how to send a BREAK with the tcsendbreak
function.
